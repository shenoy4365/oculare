# Oculare AI: Machine Learning for Eye Disease Detection

Oculare is an advanced AI-powered application designed to detect eye diseases by analyzing retinal images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The platform also integrates a healthcare chatbot capable of generating AI-driven insights from past scan reports and addressing general medical inquiries.

The application provides an interactive vision test, personalized eye health recommendations, comprehensive scan history tracking, and secure authentication via Supabase â€” all within a modern, responsive interface optimized for iOS devices.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shenoy4365/oculare.git
   cd oculare
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory.

### 4. Set up environment and IP address variables:


   ```
   supabaseUrl=your_supabase_url_key
   supabaseAnonKey=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

Note that the Google Gemini API Key is synced and saved in the userâ€™s authentication and database table (and can be updated accordingly when the user is signed into the application). Therefore, the user must provide their Google Gemini API Key in order to use Visionary AIâ€™s functionalities and capabilites. To learn more about getting your Google Gemini API Key to use Oculare, please visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for instructions and API usages.

###  5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 6. Scan the Expo React Native QR Code with your iPhone or open on the web with Expo React Native shortcuts (found in the active terminal) to see the result.
